ED-6359 Enable image resize and alignment within tables

This feature needs to be enabled with the new optional prop `media.allowResizingInTables`. By default, this is set to `false`, but will likely be promoted to default `true` in future, and then removed as an option. _Resizing_ and _alignment_ of media within tables are both tied to this prop.
