Breaking changes from previous version:
- Rename siteName to siteTitle to match what it is called in the products
- Rename isSelected prop to isHighlighted to avoid confusion with the CSS states of the button, which is also exposed as a prop to Button

Other visual changes:
- Primary buttons in the nav with dropdowns stay highlighted when the drop down is open.
- Fix active state in FF
- Gradients for Atlassian products works correctly
